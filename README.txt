\f0\fs24 \cf0 Project 01 is created as a personal blog . I am very much impressed by minimalist design, which is what I decided to apply with CSS on the static web-pages without using javascript (because of the lack of knowledge). The contents of the blog are made of some interests of the blogger.\
The directory contains 5 html files in total and 1 stylesheet, plus 1 media file which contains images of the site. Every page has a header which always links to the home page, a set of navigation elements that point to each other, and a footer where there are a set of icons that link to other social media sites. \
1. The index.html is the home page of the site. There are a photo 
\f1 of the blogger, a text of brief introduction of the blog, and A form where viewers can submit comments below. \
2. The travel page mainly displays the photographs that token by the blogger while traveling. \
3. The movie page servers as a brief introduction of recommended movies. It consists of a video cited from third-party and few parts of an article which is the review of movie. \
4. The book page recommends one of the favorite authors of the blogger and his works. The recommended books are listed in the table.\
5. The music page servers as a brief introduction of one of the blogger\'a1\'afs favorite artists and his music. It is composed of a audio element with control attribute and few images.}
