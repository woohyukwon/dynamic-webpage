                <p>Who is Vivian Maier? Now considered one of the 20th century's greatest street photographers, Vivian Maier was a mysterious nanny who secretly took over 100,000 photographs that went unseen during her lifetime. In the documentary <em>Finding Vivian Maier</em>, John Maloof and Charlie Siskel profile a reclusive photographer and her undiscovered photo archive.</p>

                In her self-portraits, the photographer Vivian Maier could be the actress playing herself in the movie of her life. She confronts the camera with utter self-possession. She affects an austere, distancing look. Her medium-format Rolleiflex is ever-present, slung around her neck, cradled at her sternum, capturing the image reflected off a store window or car mirror. Her clothes — broad hats and big coats, calculated to conceal — suggest a secret agent in a postwar film noir.
