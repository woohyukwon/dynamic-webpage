            <p id="ken">I am really not a big fan of hip-hop, but Kendrick Lamar's albums are like the cure to me. Known for his storytelling, imagery, wordplay, passion and varied song structures, Kendrick brings hard-hitting lyricism with narratives to the West Coast, not traditionally known for its lyricists.</p>

            <p class="m2">Anybody reading or listening who may be asking these questions of themselves, just remember: from “u,” you will eventually reach “i.”</p>
            <p class="m3">"The session for “U” was very uncomfortable. Lamar wrote it in the booth. The mic was on and I could hear him walking back and forth and having these super angry vocals. Then he’d start recording with the lights off and it was super emotional. I never asked what got into him that day."</p>
