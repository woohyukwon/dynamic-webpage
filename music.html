            <p>I am really not a big fan of hip-hop, but Kendrick Lamar's albums are like the cure to me. Known for his storytelling, imagery, wordplay, passion and varied song structures, Kendrick brings hard-hitting lyricism with narratives to the West Coast, not traditionally known for its lyricists.</p>

            <p class="m1">"That was one of the hardest songs I had to write. There’s some very dark moments in there. All my insecurities and selfishness and let-downs. That shit is depressing as a motherfucker. But it helps, though. It helps."</p>
            <p class="m2">Anybody reading or listening who may be asking these questions of themselves, just remember: from “u,” you will eventually reach “i.”</p>
            <p class="m3">"The session for “U” was very uncomfortable. Lamar wrote it in the booth. The mic was on and I could hear him walking back and forth and having these super angry vocals. Then he’d start recording with the lights off and it was super emotional. I never asked what got into him that day."</p>
